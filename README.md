# IDS-Search-Torch-Quizz

## Story
Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. 
They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. 
Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. 
When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, 
can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?

## Iterative Deepening Search
Iterative deepening search or more specifically iterative deepening depth-first search is a state space/graph search strategy
in which a depth-limited version of depth-first search is run repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found.
 
 **This algorithm does not find the best solution!**
